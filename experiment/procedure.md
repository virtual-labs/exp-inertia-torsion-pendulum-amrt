## Procedure

### Apparatus:
The given torsion pendulum, two identical cyllindrical masses, stop watch, metre scale, etc.

### Procedure: (for performing in lab)
#### Determination of moment of inertia using torsion pendulum with identical masses
<ol>
<li>The radius of the suspension wire is measured using a screw gauge.</li>
<li>The length of the suspension wire is adjusted to suitable values like 0.3m,0.4m,0.5m,.....0.9m,1m etc.</li>
<li>The disc is set in oscillation.Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T0 '.</li>
<li>The two identical masses are placed symmetrically on either side of the suspension wire as close as possible to the centre of the disc, and measure d1 which is the distance between the centres of the disc and one of the identical masses.</li>
<li>Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T1 '.</li>
<li>The two identical masses are placed symmetrically on either side of the suspension wire as far as possible to the centre of the disc, and measure d2 which is the distance between the centres of the disc and one of the identical masses.</li>
<li>Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T2 '.</li>
<li>Find the moment of inertia of the disc using the given formulae.</li>
</ol>
