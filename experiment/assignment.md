## Assignment


<ol>
  <li>Determine the rigidity modulus of Zinc wires of radii 0.4 mm and 0.7 mm, and show that it is independent of radius.</li>
  
  <li>Find the ratio of time periods of two identical torsion pendulums with moment of inertia I<sub>1</sub> = 25 × 10<sup>–4</sup> kg·m² and I<sub>2</sub> = 12.5 × 10<sup>–4</sup> kg·m².</li>
  
  <li>Find the rigidity modulus of the copper wire of radius 0.5 mm and length 60 cm.</li>
  
  <li>Find the moment of inertia of a given disc of mass 1.5 kg and radius 7 cm.</li>
  
  <li>Find both the moment of inertia of the disc and the rigidity modulus of a Zinc suspension wire.<br>
      Given: radius and length of the suspension wire are 0.6 mm and 60 cm.<br>
      Take the mass and radius of the disc as 1.5 kg and 7 cm respectively.
